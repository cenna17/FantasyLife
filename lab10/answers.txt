Queastion 1 & 2: Dot product runtime (.S vs .C && double precision vs float - single precision)
Double precision took longer than single precision but not by much (marginal).  
Interestingly, the C implementaitons are all running much faster than the Assembly implementation.

For the polynomial evaluation:
(Prediction: the differences should be much more obvious here.)

The .C implementaiton were faster than all Assembly implementations equivalent. (I use _S below to
denot assembly version)
MPS_C FASTER THAN MPS_S
MPD_C1 FASTER THAN MPD_S
MPD_C2 SLOWER THAN MPD_S

Results table:
             dot_double_c took    68.3 ms
               dot_double took    74.3 ms
             dot_single_c took    66.6 ms
               dot_single took    71.9 ms
       map_poly_double_c1 took   114.1 ms
       map_poly_double_c2 took   181.8 ms
          map_poly_double took   156.0 ms
        map_poly_single_c took    62.0 ms
          map_poly_single took    88.0 ms


Question 3: What is the relative running time of the x87-based sine calculation vs the C implementation (that uses its own implementation of the function)?

Using an input of 100K entries of doubles in my arrays, the Assembly version took noticebly more time than C (nearly 2x).

Results:
sin_stdlib took     3.0 ms
sin_x87 took     5.3 ms
