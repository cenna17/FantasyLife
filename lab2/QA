########################################QUESTION 1
The function gives a number that is larger than another number.
########################################QUESTION 2
The values of A B C were stored in NON-PRESERVE registers 
before.  When calling f_function, should that funciton decide to use 
any one of the registers that were used to store A B C, then the values
for ABC will be overwritten by whatever the f_function gives it.

However, call preserved registers guarantees that no matter how register 
values are changed from other functions using them, it always resets
the value to what it is before the call was made.

In other words, an outside function I call may use the registers even if I do 
not pass them as parameters or modify them in my code.
